# text-to-handwriting

Text to Handwriting Converter 📝✍

Magic happens here! 🔮

This Python script uses the pywhatkit library to convert user-input text into beautiful handwriting and save it as an image file. 🎨

How it works:

1. Import Libraries 📚
    - pywhatkit (as pw) for text-to-handwriting conversion 📝
    - time for time-related functions ⏰
2. Infinite Loop 🔁
    - Continues running until explicitly broken 🔴
3. Try Block 💻
    - Prompts user to enter text for conversion 💬
    - Converts text to handwriting using pywhatkit ✍
    - Saves image file as pywhatkit.png with blue RGB color 🎨
    - Prints confirmation message 📣
    - Breaks out of loop, ending program 🛑
4. Error Handling 🚨
    - Catches UnableToAccessApi exception from pywhatkit 🤖
    - Prints error message indicating API access failure 📛
    - Pauses execution for 5 seconds before retrying loop ⏱

Features:

- User-input text conversion to handwriting 📝
- Image file saving with customizable RGB color 🎨
